I've spent years thinking about starting a personal site. 

It'd be a small corner of the internet to call my own - a place to log projects, thoughts, and outline new ideas. But alas, here we are... years have passed and nothing exists.

In a way, my personal site has been like the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus), bit by bit, piece by piece, continuously reconstructed. Of course, there's one major difference: this ship never left the dry dock. UNTIL NOW!

We're finally sending this ship to sea. This is our launch. The first post of many.
