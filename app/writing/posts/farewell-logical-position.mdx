After 8.5 years at Logical Position, my time with the company has come to an end. I’m officially funemployed and between jobs.

It’s been a pretty wild ride as my first gig coming out of college. There were ups and downs as you may expect, but I'm thankful for all the amazing people who made it such a great experience and helped build some really cool stuff along the way.

I plan to write a full retro on my time at LP, but my last month outside of transitioning responsibilities was spent brain dumping so much documentation that I'm surprised I have the mental capacity to write this little post.

## So What’s Next?

To be completely honest, I'm not quite sure - beyond taking a brief break to do absolutely nothing. Though one thing seems naturally obvious at this point considering the time of year... 

**LAUNCH INTO THE GREATEST WINTER ARC OF MY LIFE**.

I've let a number of things atrophy over the last several years, so the current game plan is simple: make up for lost time and get back to shipping. The next several months will be dedicated to excessive amounts of reading, tinkering, and building things that spark my interest. Time to dive into as many ~~rabbit holes~~ black holes as possible.

I don't have the longest runway, so I’ll need to either build something for ramen money, or become a 9-5 guy once again, but for now, I’m looking forward to the self-directed exploration.
